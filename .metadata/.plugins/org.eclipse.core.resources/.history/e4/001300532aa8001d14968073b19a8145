1. A company pays its employees on a weekly basis. The employees are of four types: 
a. Salaried employees are paid a fixed weekly salary regardless of the number of hours worked, 
b. hourly employees are paid by the hour and receive overtime pay (i.e., 1.5 times their hourly salary rate) for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours, 
c. commission employees are paid 15 percent of their sales and 
d. base-salaried commission employees receive a base salary plus 12 percent of their sales.
For the current pay period, the company has decided to reward bonus to base-salaried-commission employees by adding 10% to their base salaries.
